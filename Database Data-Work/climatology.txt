It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-11-17T17:13:01","2019-08-21","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Agriculture###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-17.0950333###59.81330003###-1.6352942###37.38137246","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Agriculture/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_AG_FF_RCP85_Hotspots_Raster.zip###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Agriculture/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_AG_FF_RCP85_Hotspots.tif###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Agriculture/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_AG_FF_RCP85_Hotspots_Map.pdf###https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/RICCAR/VHS/wms?service=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilities###https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/3/VHS###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/75f362c9-8650-4918-9b2f-a94f25cd3694/thumbnail/vhs_f.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-08-25T19:18:50","2019-08-21","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Water###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-17.10150146###59.8151652###-1.65820333###37.38346333","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/3/VF###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/7bd976a2-c3d0-4d8f-8ac7-ebf1e75aca47/thumbnail/v_f.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the context of climate change, exposure refers to changes in climate parameters that might affect socio-ecological systems. Using on the open-source hydrological model HYPE and bias-corrected Regional Climate Models (RCM) results as inputs, the Regional Hydrological Model (RHM) ensemble is employed to assess hydrological change based on future climate projections. The RHM ensemble adopts the same time periods used by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and other regional climate modelling experiments. It runs climate simulations based on three future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period. Available at approximately 1km pixel resolution, for 1986-2005 reference period, the raster grids are generated for moderate and high representative concentration pathways (RCPs), emission scenarios developed by the IPCC for informing global and regional climate modelling work (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).

Vulnerability is a concept used to express the complex interaction of climate change effects and the susceptibility of a system to its impacts. The integrated vulnerability assessment methodology is based on an understanding of vulnerability as a function of a system’s climate change exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to cope with climate change effects, consistent with the approach put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Combining exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity allows assessing the vulnerability of a system to climate change. The integrated vulnerability assessment combines a series of single vulnerability assessments for several water-related climate change impacts on different sectors.

Pixel values were classified according to level of vulnerability, from low 1 to high 10. Vulnerability is a concept used to express the complex interaction of climate change effects and the susceptibility of a system to its impacts. The integrated vulnerability assessment methodology is based on an understanding of vulnerability as a function of a system’s climate change exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to cope with climate change effects, consistent with the approach put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-08-23T09:26:12","2019-08-22","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Agriculture###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-17.0950333###59.81330003###-1.6352942###37.37303913","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/RICCAR/3/VRP###https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/RICCAR/VRP/wms?VERSION=1.1.1","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/daf997de-4499-4af7-8206-d736681cfc61/thumbnail/v_rp.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

WP3 aimed at quantifying the sensitivity of vegetation productivity and water resources to seasonal, inter-annual and decadal variability in weather and climate, using impact models on agriculture and water. The available models in combination with developed datasets of land use and climate from WP2 were used to simulate crop yield and water resources. Simulations using short-term scenarios of future climate change (5-10 years) were used to identify regional differences in the climate sensitivity of crop production etc. Scenarios for the African agricultural/pastoral sectors were also made using longer model runs. Finally, tradeoffs and areas of risk and vulnerability were identified in relation to: - Water-related hazards; - Agricultural and pastoral performance; - Soil degradation.

Rainfall data are also available in GeoNetwork for the whole African continent and the following Regions : Northern Africa, Western Africa, Eastern Africa and Southern Africa. An interpolation method (Kriging) is applied to input data. Data input for rainfall maps are provided by Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) operated by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD, National Meteorological Service of Germany). GPCC First Guess Product, gauge-based gridded monthly precipitation data sets for the global land surface, at spatial resolutions of 1.0 x 1.0 degrees geographical latitude by longitude are used. The First Guess Product of the monthly precipitation anomaly is based on interpolated precipitation anomalies from about 6,000 stations worldwide. Data sources are synoptic weather observation data (SYNOP) received at DWD via the WMO Global Telecommunication System (GTS) and climatic mean (mainly 1961-1990) monthly precipitation totals at the same stations extracted from GPCC s global normals collection. An automatic-only quality-control (QC) is applied to these data.

When the focus is on monitoring performance of irrigated agriculture in relation to water consumption, it is more appropriate to use transpiration alone as a denominator, as a measure of water beneficially consumed by the plant.

The integrated vulnerability assessment methodology is based on an understanding of vulnerability as a function of a system’s climate change exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to cope with climate change effects, consistent with the approach put forward by the IPCC in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-08-22T11:08:57","2019-08-21","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Water###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-17.0950333###59.81709472###-1.6352942###37.38038511","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/3/VF###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/0d39a964-b468-4067-8892-34b4235e310f/thumbnail/v_f.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-11-17T17:12:41","2019-08-24","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Water###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-17.10150146###59.8151652###-1.65820333###37.38346333","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/People%20-%20Water%20Available%20for%20Drinking/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_HHC_FF_RCP85_Hotspots_Raster.zip###https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/RICCAR/VHS/wms?service=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilities###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/People%20-%20Water%20Available%20for%20Drinking/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_HHC_FF_RCP85_Hotspots.tif###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/People%20-%20Human%20Health%20Conditions%20due%20to%20Heat%20Stress/HHC_Impact_Chain.pdf###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/People%20-%20Water%20Available%20for%20Drinking/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_HHC_FF_RCP85_Hotspots_Map.pdf###https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/RICCAR/3/VHS###https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/RICCAR/VHS/wms?VERSION=1.1.1","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/e89d470b-a3b5-46df-9296-1b590c0d2da0/thumbnail/vhs_f.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-08-22T11:07:34","2019-08-21","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Water###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-17.0950333###59.81709472###-1.6352942###37.38038511","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/3/VF###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/d3f9237a-bc62-466c-82b2-832cee02cc70/thumbnail/v_f.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pixel values were classified according to vulnerability level: class 10 the top 10%, class 20 top 20% and class 30 top 30%. Vulnerability is a concept used to express the complex interaction of climate change effects and the susceptibility of a system to its impacts. The integrated vulnerability assessment methodology is based on an understanding of vulnerability as a function of a system’s climate change exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to cope with climate change effects, consistent with the approach put forward by the IPCC in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-11-17T17:12:46","2019-08-24","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Biodiversity and Ecosystems###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-17.02862999###59.73803668###-1.62680625###37.28986042","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Wetlands/ACW_Impact_Chain.pdf###https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/RICCAR/VHS/wms?service=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilities###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Wetlands/Hotspots/Mid-Century%20(2046-2065)%20/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ACW_IF_RCP85_Hotspots_Raster.zip###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Wetlands/Hotspots/Mid-Century%20(2046-2065)%20/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ACW_IF_RCP85_Hotspots.tif###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Wetlands/Hotspots/Mid-Century%20(2046-2065)%20/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ACW_IF_RCP85_Hotspots_Map.pdf###https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/3/VHS###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/d02fefaa-01ff-40ed-82ae-7b01679268c9/thumbnail/vhs_f.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

CRUTS32 as climate data source is used based on historical data for the time period 1981-2010. The Multi-cropping classification dataset is part of the GAEZ v4 Theme 2 Agro-climatic Resources, Climate classification sub-theme. In the GAEZ crop suitability analysis, the LUTs considered refer to single cropping of sole crops, i.e., each crop is presumed to occupy the land only once a year and in pure stand. Consequently, in areas where the growing periods are sufficiently long to allow more than one crop to be grown in the same year or season, single crop yields of annual crops do not reflect the full potential of total time available each year for rain-fed or irrigated crop production. To assess the multiple cropping potential, a number of multiple cropping zones have been defined through matching both growth cycle and temperature requirements of individual suitable crops with time available for crop growth. For rain-fed conditions this period is approximated by the LGP, i.e., the number of days during which both temperature and moisture conditions permit crop growth. Under irrigation conditions the length of the temperature growing period and annual accumulated temperature sums are decisive.

Within the Vulnerability Assessment conceptual framework, Exposure refers to changes in climate parameters that might affect socio-ecological systems, Sensitivity provides information about the status quo of the physical and natural environment that makes the affected systems particularly susceptible, and the Potential Impact is determined by combining the exposure and sensitivity of a system. The integrated vulnerability assessment combines a series of single vulnerability assessments for several water-related climate change impacts on different sectors. It adopts the time periods generally used by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and other regional climate modelling experiments, and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.

Vulnerability is a concept used to express the complex interaction of climate change effects and the susceptibility of a system to its impacts. In the context of climate change, exposure refers to changes in climate parameters that might affect socio-ecological systems. The integrated vulnerability assessment combines a series of single vulnerability assessments for several water-related climate change impacts on different sectors.

It is an average of the dekadal VHI values over the crop growing season (from the start until the last dekad of analysis), weighted by crop coefficients (Kc), assigned to VHI values at the dekads corresponding to the Start of the Season (SOS), Maximum of the Season (MOS) and End of the Season (EOS). Crop coefficient is applied for the purpose of reflecting the crop’s water sensitivity at different phenology stages. Weighted Mean VHI Annual Summary is processed at the end of crop season. It allows the user to assess the overall severity of drought for an entire growing season. Two quick-look indicators in ASIS: Agricultural Stress Index (ASI) and Drought Intensity are both based Mean-VHI dataset.

Within the Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 2015 (GAR15), the global flood hazard assessment uses a probabilistic approach for modelling riverine flood major river basins around the globe. The time span in the global stream-flow dataset is long enough to allow extreme value analysis. Where time series of flow discharges were too short or incomplete, they were improved with proxy data from stations located in the same “homogeneous region.” Homogeneous regions were calculated taking into account information such as climatic zones, hydrological characteristics of the catchments, and statistical parameters of the streamflow data. - The calculated discharge quantiles were introduced to river sections, whose geometries were derived from topographic data (SRTM), and used with a simplified approach (based on Manning’s equation) to model water levels downstream. This procedure allowed for the determination of the reference Flood hazard maps for different return periods (6 are shown in the global study: T= 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 years). The hazard maps are developed at 1kmx1km resolution. Such maps have been validated against satellite flood footprints from different sources (DFO archive, UNOSAT flood portal) and well performed especially for the big events For smaller events (lower return periods), the GAR Flood hazard maps tend to overestimate with respect to similar maps produced locally (hazard maps where available for some countries and were used as benchmark).

The risk map shows near real-time forecasted hotspots of vector amplification and potential of RVF outbreaks for the month ahead based on average cumulative NDVI anomalies from MODIS images (250 m) over the past consecutive three months period. The map is updated on monthly basis. This dynamic prediction model used by FAO builds upon the work by Anyamba et al., (2009; 2010), that utilizes vegetation and rainfall anomalies as a proxy for ecological dynamics to map areas at potential risk of RVF in Eastern Africa. If the algorithm predicts a warm event like El Niño and persistently show areas of unusually high rain and vegetation, the risk of a vector amplification is high. Consequently, the co-occurrence of susceptible livestock species and humans in suitable forecasted areas enhances the likelihood of an RVF outbreak. The FAO RVF Early Warning panel of experts verifies the risk areas with the FAO officers on the ground and assesses if conditions warrant an RVF alert (FAO 2019).

It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-11-17T17:12:54","2019-08-24","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-17.10153###59.81934201###-1.65820333###37.38370795","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/People%20-%20Human%20Health%20Conditions%20due%20to%20Heat%20Stress/Hotspots/Mid-Century%20(2046-2065)%20/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ER4AG_IF_RCP85_Hotspots_Raster.zip###https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/RICCAR/VHS/wms?service=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilities###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/People%20-%20Human%20Health%20Conditions%20due%20to%20Heat%20Stress/Hotspots/Mid-Century%20(2046-2065)%20/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ER4AG_IF_RCP85_Hotspots.tif###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/People%20-%20Human%20Health%20Conditions%20due%20to%20Heat%20Stress/Hotspots/Mid-Century%20(2046-2065)%20/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ER4AG_IF_RCP85_Hotspots_Map.pdf###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/People%20-%20Employment%20Rate%20for%20the%20Agricultural%20Sector/ER4AG_Impact_Chain.pdf###https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/3/VHS###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/75235f37-65c0-493d-8372-2d51c61f1ae8/thumbnail/vhs_f.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ASI related products (maps, spatial aggregation based on administrative unit) are processed by FAO GIEWS (Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture) every 10 days. ASI Annual Summary is processed at the end of crop season. It depicts the percentage of arable land, within an administrative area, that has been affected by drought conditions over the entire cropping season. It differs from ASI dekadal product, which is based on conditions from the start of the season up to the current dekad. The Index is based on the integration of the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) in two dimensions that are critical in the assessment of a drought event in agriculture: temporal and spatial. The first step of the ASI calculation is a temporal averaging of the VHI, assessing the intensity and duration of dry periods occurring during the crop cycle at the pixel level; this calculation includes the use of crop coefficients, which introduces sensitivity of a crop to water stress during each phenological phase. The second step determines the spatial extent of drought events by calculating the percentage of pixels in arable areas with a VHI value below 35 percent (this value was identified as a critical threshold in assessing the extent of drought in previous research by Kogan, 1995). Each administrative area is classified according to the percentage of the affected area to facilitate the quick interpretation of results.

𝑉𝐶𝐼𝑖=(𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼𝑖−𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼𝑚𝑖𝑛) / (𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼𝑚𝑎𝑥−𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼𝑚𝑖𝑛) Together with Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) is used to calculate Vegetation Health Index (VHI) using formula: VHI=0.5*VCI+0.5*TCI In ASIS, VCI is computed in two modality: dekadal and monthly. The dekadal/monthly VCI raster layer published in Hand in Hand Geospatial platform is further updated in the following 5 dekads (improve data precision, remove cloud pixel etc.).

Warning: These \"data\" are not based on reanalysis of observations, but just on modeling with initial and boundary conditions from CMCC-CPS output. The high resolution modeling is an experiment. Especially the calculated precipitation may have systematic deviations from the observations. The purpose of these synthetic data is to test the merit or lack of merit of high-resolution modeling. The model grid is not aligned with latitude and longitude, so interpolation of the data may be necessary. The output is stored in separate files for each grid. Data content: 1.Temperature at 20 m (°C); 2. Specific humidity at 20 m (g/kg); 3. Wind speed at 20 m; 4. Wind direction at 20 m; 5. Short wave radiation (W/m2); 6. Sensible heat flux (W/m2); 7. Latent heat flux (W/m2, can be converted directly to evaporation in mm/h); 8. Cumulated precipitation (mm); Data storage: presently the data are stored in binary files. For each month there are 4 files: one file per ½ calender month - grid - combination. After conversion to text format, the size is about 2.5 Mb (outer grid) or almost 2 Mb (inner grid) for each simulated hour. The size of the whole set converted to ASCII is over 400 Gb.

It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-11-17T17:12:51","2019-08-24","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Biodiversity and Ecosystems###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-17.02862999###59.73803668###-1.62680625###37.28986042","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Wetlands/ACW_Impact_Chain.pdf###https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/RICCAR/VHS/wms?service=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilities###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Wetlands/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ACW_FF_RCP85_Hotspots_Raster.zip###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Wetlands/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ACW_FF_RCP85_Hotspots.tif###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Wetlands/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ACW_FF_RCP85_Hotspots_Map.pdf###https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/3/VHS###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/0449dedc-aa73-4487-b4c9-fa5fcf37b3cb/thumbnail/vhs_f.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The historical tropical cyclones used in GAR15 cyclone wind and storm surge model are from five different oceanic basins: Northeast Pacific, Northwest Pacific, South Pacific, North Indian, South Indian and North Atlantic and the tracks were obtained from the IBTrACS database (Knapp et al. 2010). This database represents the repository of information associated with tropical cyclones that is the most up to date. Topography was taken from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) of NASA, which provides terrain elevation grids at a 90 meters resolution, delivered by quadrants over the world. To account for surface roughness, polygons of urban areas worldwide were obtained from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Centre, SEDAC (CIESIN et al., 2011). This was considered a good proxy of the spatial variation of surface roughness. A digital bathymetry model is employed with a spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds, taken from the GEBCO_08 (General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans) Grid Database of the British Oceanographic Data Centre (2009). Bathymetry is the information about the underwater floor of the ocean having direct influence on the formation of the storm surge. More information about the cyclone wind and strom surge hazard can be found in CIMNE et al., 2015a. Hazard analysis was performed using the software CAPRA Team Tropical Cyclones Hazard Modeler (Bernal, 2014). The vulnerability models used in the risk calculation for GAR correlate loss to the wind speed for 3-seconds gusts. For GAR15, the risk was calculated with the CAPRA-GIS platform which is risk modelling tool of the CAPRA suite (www.ecapra.org). The risk assessment was also conducted by CIMNE and Ingeniar to produced AAL and PML values for cyclone risk.","dataset","2022-02-15T12:49:17","2022-01-26","wind###cyclone###climate hazards###weather###Climate risk indicators###World","","","-180.00###180.00###-90.00###90.00","copyright###license###","https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms/CRTB/HAZ_BI/v1?service=WMS&version=1.3.0&request=GetCapabilities","NetCDF 4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The available models in combination with developed datasets of land use and climate from WP2 were used to simulate crop yield and water resources. Simulations using short-term scenarios of future climate change (5-10 years) were used to identify regional differences in the climate sensitivity of crop production etc. Scenarios for the African agricultural/pastoral sectors were also made using longer model runs. Finally, tradeoffs and areas of risk and vulnerability were identified in relation to: - Water-related hazards; - Agricultural and pastoral performance; - Soil degradation.

The raster grid was generated for End-Century time period (2081-2100), for high emission scenario - representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) - developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Pixel values were classified according to vulnerability level: class 10 the top 10%, class 20 top 20% and class 30 top 30%. Vulnerability is a concept used to express the complex interaction of climate change effects and the susceptibility of a system to its impacts. The integrated vulnerability assessment methodology is based on an understanding of vulnerability as a function of a system’s climate change exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to cope with climate change effects, consistent with the approach put forward by the IPCC in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It adopts the time periods generally used by the IPCC and other regional climate modelling experiments and runs climate simulations based on future time periods that are compared with a historical reference period.","dataset","2019-11-17T17:13:00","2019-08-24","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Biodiversity and Ecosystems###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-12.33081669###59.5264274###-1.62680624###37.3796632","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://io.apps.fao.org/gismgr/api/v1/RICCAR/VHS/wms?service=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&request=GetCapabilities###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Forests/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ACF_FF_RCP85_Hotspots_Raster.zip###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Forests/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ACF_FF_RCP85_Hotspots.tif###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Forests/Hotspots/End-Century%20(2081-2100)/High%20(RCP85)/VHS_ACF_FF_RCP85_Hotspots_Map.pdf###https://data.apps.fao.org/static/data/RICCAR/MENA/Vulnerability%20Assessment/Biodiversity%20and%20Ecosystems%20-%20Area%20Covered%20by%20Forests/ACF_Impact_Chain.pdf###https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/3/VHS###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/e09c0b95-15bf-4935-9586-e52e6f794ef9/thumbnail/vhs_f.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The following data is used to calculate ETref: daily incoming solar radiation and weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed).","dataset","2022-06-13T13:53:20","2020","Evapotranspiration###Reference Evapotranspiration###Water Accounting###ADB###Monthly###Middle Krishna sub-basin###K2 sub-basin###Krishna river basin###Karnataka###India","India","IHE-Delft/ e.salvadore@un-ihe.org","64.0459###91.7382###4.7345###37.0255","copyright###license###Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO (CC BY-NC- SA 3.0 IGO)","https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms/WATER/K2_ET_REF/v2?service=WMS&version=1.3.0&request=GetCapabilities","netCDF","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a new indicator introduced in ASIS 2 (2018). Agricultural droughts are classified by their intensity and are categorized into four classes: Extreme, Severe, Moderate or Mild. The intensity of drought in ASIS is calculated through the weighted Mean Vegetation Health Index, indicating that the poorer the vegetation health the more severe the drought. The Annual summary of Drought Intensity is processed at the end of crop season. It allows the user to assess the overall intensity of drought for an entire growing season.

Thus, in a formal sense, LGP refers to the number of days within the period of temperatures above 5°C when moisture conditions are considered adequate. Under rain-fed conditions, the begin of the LGP is linked to the start of the rainy season.

Dry climates are divided into arid (BW) and semi-arid (BS) subtypes. Other climate types are sub-divided according to seasonal precipitation characteristics. The level-3 classification distinguishes 31 classes where additional temperature criteria are applied comparing to the level-2 classification for a further subdivision in temperate and cold climates (classes with capital letters B and C).

This dataset is derived from the Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset for Land Surface Modeling, produced by the Princeton University [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering]. The source data is a 150-yr (1948-2099) dataset of meteorological forcings for driving land surface models and other land modeling schemes. It is derived by bias correcting and downscaling WCRP CMIP3 climate model data for the 20th century and 21st century future climate projections. The dataset is bias-corrected and downscaled using the newly developed equidistant quantile matching method (Li et al., 2010) which better represents changes in the full distribution (not just the mean change). In addition to precipitation and temperature, radiation, humidity, pressure and windspeed are also downscaled. The downsclaing is based on the observational based global forcing dataset of Sheffield et al. (2006) also available from this website. The dataset is currently available at 1.0 degree, 3-hourly resolution globally for 1948-2008. Experimental versions include a 1901-2008 version, real-time updates, higher resolution versions at 0.25deg and 0.5deg and future climate projections based on bias-corrected climate model output. The data are currently available for one climate model (NCAR-PCM1) for the 20th century historical forcing (20C3M; 1948-2000) and one future climate scenario (SRES A2; 2001-2099).

It provides a collective quick-look indicators that facilitate the early identification of cropland/grassland with a high likelihood of water stress (drought). ASIS related products (maps, zonal statistics) are processed by FAO GIEWS (Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture) every 10 days. Pre-processed, published-ready maps, zonal statistics of ASIS are published FAO GIEWS Earth Observation website at: https://www.fao.org/giews/earthobservation/index.jsp?lang=en. All ASIS raster datasets are accessible through the FAO Hand-in-Hand Geospatial Portal, Web Map Service (WMS) and Google Earth Engine (GEE). More information, please visit ASIS Data Access page: https://www.fao.org/giews/earthobservation/access.jsp?lang=en Agricultural Stress Index System is composed of two type of indicators: seasonal indicators such as Agricultural Stress Index (ASI) to detect the severe agricultural drought, Drought Intensity to classify the severity of the drought and no-seasonal indicators, such as vegetation indicators (NDVI anomaly, VCI and VHI). The seasonal indicators are designed to allow easy identification of areas of cropped land with a high likelihood of water stress (drought). The indices are based on remote sensing data of vegetation and land surface temperature combined with information on agricultural cropping cycles derived from historical data and a global crop mask. The final maps highlight anomalous vegetation growth and potential drought in crop zones during the growing season. In ASIS, two cropping cycles (major season /minor season) and crop/grassland zones are applied. Some countries have three or four crop seasons within a crop year. For these countries, Global ASIS cannot properly capture the agricultural drought occurred between the first and the last season (e.g. for a country has four crop seasons, the drought occurred during the 2nd and 3rd season). The satellite data used in the calculation of the mean VHI and the ASI is the 10-day (dekadal) vegetation data from the METOP-AVHRR sensor at 1 km resolution (2007 and after). Data at 1 km resolution for the period 1984-2006 was derived from the NOAA-AVHRR dataset at 16 km resolution. The crop/grass mask is FAO GLC-SHARE. Pixel with at least 5% covered by the class is defined as a cropland/grassland pixel.

It depicts the percentage of arable land, within an administrative area, that has been affected by drought conditions from the start of the season up to the current dekad. It differs from ASI Annual product which describes the drought conditions over the entire crop season. The Index is based on the integration of the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) in two dimensions that are critical in the assessment of a drought event in agriculture: temporal and spatial. The first step of the ASI calculation is a temporal averaging of the VHI, assessing the intensity and duration of dry periods occurring during the crop cycle at the pixel level; this calculation includes the use of crop coefficients, which introduces sensitivity of a crop to water stress during each phenological phase. The second step determines the spatial extent of drought events by calculating the percentage of pixels in arable areas with a VHI value below 35 percent (this value was identified as a critical threshold in assessing the extent of drought in previous research by Kogan, 1995). Each administrative area is classified according to the percentage of the affected area to facilitate the quick interpretation of results.","dataset","2022-12-13T14:29:53","","Agricultural Drought###Crop growing condition###Early Warning System###Vegetatation Index###HiH_ASIS###HiH_GIEWS_OB###Global, Countries","Continents","FAO-UN/ giews1@fao.org","-180.004464###179.995536###-56.0044643###75.0044643","copyright###copyright###Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 IGO (CC BY-NC- SA 3.0 IGO)","http://www.fao.org/giews/earthobservation/asis/index_1.jsp?lang=en###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms/ASIS/ASI_D/v2?service=WMS&version=1.3.0&request=GetCapabilities","PNG","https://data.review.fao.org:/map/catalog/srv/api/records/66b7d407-edd4-490e-8b71-a9b7db6527f3/attachments/ot2018h_aC1_s1_g2.png","","2014","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Multi-cropping classification dataset is part of the GAEZ v4 Theme 2 Agro-climatic Resources, Climate Classification sub-theme. In the GAEZ crop suitability analysis, the LUTs considered refer to single cropping of sole crops, i.e., each crop is presumed to occupy the land only once a year and in pure stand. Consequently, in areas where the growing periods are sufficiently long to allow more than one crop to be grown in the same year or season, single crop yields of annual crops do not reflect the full potential of total time available each year for rain-fed or irrigated crop production. To assess the multiple cropping potential, a number of multiple cropping zones have been defined through matching both growth cycle and temperature requirements of individual suitable crops with time available for crop growth. For rain-fed conditions this period is approximated by the LGP, i.e., the number of days during which both temperature and moisture conditions permit crop growth. Under irrigation conditions the length of the temperature growing period and annual accumulated temperature sums are decisive.

The integrated vulnerability assessment methodology is based on an understanding of vulnerability as a function of a system’s climate change exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to cope with climate change effects, consistent with the approach put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Within this conceptual framework, Sensitivity provides information about the status quo of the physical and natural environment that makes the affected systems particularly susceptible to climate change.

The available models in combination with developed datasets of land use and climate from WP2 were used to simulate crop yield and water resources. Simulations using short-term scenarios of future climate change (5-10 years) were used to identify regional differences in the climate sensitivity of crop production etc. Scenarios for the African agricultural/pastoral sectors were also made using longer model runs.

Vulnerability is a concept used to express the complex interaction of climate change effects and the susceptibility of a system to its impacts. The integrated vulnerability assessment methodology is based on an understanding of vulnerability as a function of a system’s climate change exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to cope with climate change effects, consistent with the approach put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Within this conceptual framework, Sensitivity provides information about the status quo of the physical and natural environment that makes the affected systems particularly susceptible to climate change. The integrated vulnerability assessment combines a series of single vulnerability assessments for several water-related climate change impacts on different sectors. A class value of 1 was assigned to represent a favorable condition (low sensitivity) while a class value of 10 designates an unfavorable condition.","dataset","2019-11-12T09:41:14","2019-08-13","Vulnerability###RICCAR###Climate change###Water###MENA - Middle East North Africa###Arab Region","","/","-12.33081669###59.5264274###-1.62680624###37.3796632","copyright###otherRestictions###","https://rkh.apps.fao.org/catalog/3/SEN###https://io.apps.fao.org/geoserver/wms","GeoTIFF","https://storage.googleapis.com/fao-maps-catalog-data/uuid/b9a2d588-6e15-45e0-92b2-abe0f6d2545a/thumbnail/sen.png","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 1951-1975 and 1976-2000 PERIOD: Differences in climatic npp between the 1951-1975 and 1976-2000 period appear in some regions of the world. The data shows the latitudinal dependence of these differences. It demonstrates that npp would have increased for most latitudes if temperature were the limiting factor. However, especially between 0 and 20 degrees North the npp decreased because of its precipitation dependency. High resolution images of the differences in npp between 1951-1975 and 1976-2000 for the CRU/VASClimO dataset are also provided here as GeoTIFF for download. CLIMATIC SENSITIVITY OF NPP: The sensitivity of NPP with respect to changes in annual mean temperature dNPP/dT and annual mean precipitation dNPP/dP has been calculated for each location on earth.

Changes in the vegetation phenology, including the start of season, the length of the season as well as the end of season impacts the ecosystem functioning such as carbon storage, water holding capacity and agricultural productivity. Compliment to ASIS Crop/pasture growing seasons (Start of season, Maximum of season and End of Season) maps, Progress of Season (POS) maps depict the development of crops/pastures during the growing season. For any dekad (a 10-day period), the map indicates how far the season has progressed, represented by a value between 0 and 100 percent (i.e. 50 percent is the mid-point of the growing season). The seasons’ progress is based on the long-term average of vegetation phenology for each pixel. This simplification implies that the crop/pasture phenology is static and, therefore, the growing seasons progress at a constant rate each year. The “seasonal progress” is expressed in relative terms via a fixed set of “POS images”. For any dekad in the year, they indicate for each pixel how the season has progressed. That can be a value between 0 and 100 percent (i.e. 50 percent is the mid-point of the growing season). The definition of a dekad: - Each month has three dekads: dekad 1 (day 1-10), dekad 2 (day 11-20), dekad 3 (day 21-end of month). - The number of days the dekad represents is variable for each last dekad of the month. - Since the phenology is derived from dekadal temporally smoothed and gap filled NDVI data, these dekads represent +- the middle day of their period. - The best practice is to link each dekad value with its associated date (e.g. Dekad 1 = January 5th/6th, dekad 3 = January 26th,…). Then you can convert these dates into Julian days. Phenology digital values to physical values: - In order to deal with growing seasons surpassing the calendar year (e.g. SOS <January or EOS > December) the phenology data is stored in a range of 108 dekads. The digital values in images follow the 1-108 dekad range. There is an offset of 36 dekads in order to express them with the target year as reference. - Dekad 37-72 represents the dekad 1-36 (January – December) of the target year. Values lower than 36 indicate SOS phenology < January and values higher than 72 indicate EOS phenology > December. Global ASIS covers two crop/pasture seasons. Some countries have three or four crop seasons within a crop year. For these countries, Global ASIS cannot properly capture the crop phenology between the first and the last season (e.g. for a country has four crop seasons, the crop phenology of the 2nd and 3rd season).

Soil moisture conditions together with other climate characteristics (radiation and temperature) during different crop development stages are used in an eco-physiological crop growth model to calculate potential biomass production and yield. The constraint-free crop yields calculated in the AEZ biomass model reflect yield potentials with regard to temperature and radiation regimes prevailing in each grid-cell. Maximum biomass and yields depend on the timing of the crop growth cycle (crop calendar) and are separately calculated for irrigated and rain-fed conditions. Crop specific requirements are matched with temperature regimes prevailing in individual grid-cells. Matching is tested for the full range of possible starting dates. For rain-fed conditions the crop calendar resulting in the highest expected (water-limited) yield is selected to represent maximum biomass and agro-climatic potential yield of the respective crop in a particular grid-cell. The estimation of yield losses due to water stress is based on crop-specific water balances. Yield estimation for irrigation conditions assumes that irrigation is scheduled such that no yield-reducing crop water deficits occur during the crop growth cycle. Differences in crop types and production systems are empirically characterized by the concept of Land Utilization Types (LUTs). A LUT comprises technical specifications for crop production within a given socioeconomic setting. Specific LUT attributes include agronomic information, type of the main produce, water supply type, information on typical cultivation practices, and utilization of main produce. GAEZ v4 distinguishes more than 300 crops/LUTs per level of inputs/management, which are separately assessed for rain-fed and irrigated conditions. These LUTs are grouped into 67 crop sub-types and 53 different food, feed, fiber, and bio-energy crops. Theme 3 provides crop-wise information about: (1) Agro-Climatic Yield, (2) Constraint Factors, (3) Growth Cycle Attributes, and (4) Land Utilization Types (LUT) Selection.

GAEZ provides a framework for establishing a spatial inventory of land resources. Global environmental datasets provide the spatial characteristics required for land productivity assessments concerning location-speciﬁc agro-ecological conditions. The land resources inventory contains spatial layers of climate, land cover, soil, elevation and terrain slopes, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value, administrative units, watersheds, population and livestock distribution. Theme 1: Land and Water Resources provides selected layers of the GAEZ v4 land resources database organized in several sub-themes of (1) Agro-ecological Zones, (2) Land Cover, (3) Soil Resources, (4) Soil Suitability, (5) Terrain Resources, (6) Exclusion Areas, (7) Water Resources, and (8) Selected Socio-economic Data. Results of this theme are presented in a regular raster format of 5 arc-minute (about 9 x 9 km at the equator) grid cells. Selected maps related to AEZ classification, soil suitability, terrain slopes and land cover are provided at 30 arc-second (0.9 x 0.9 km) resolution. The GAEZ v4 update includes 2010 baseline data comprising land cover, a harmonized global soil database and terrain data, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value. Climatic conditions are based on a time series of historical data of 1961-2010 and a selection of future climate simulations (30-year average of years 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2070-2099) using recent IPCC AR5 Earth System Model (ESM) outputs for four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).

Changes in the vegetation phenology, including the start of season, the length of the season as well as the end of season impacts the ecosystem functioning such as carbon storage, water holding capacity and agricultural productivity. Crop/pasture phenology maps depict the progress of the seasons. It is based on the long-term average of vegetation phenology for each pixel (In ASIS, Cropland/Grassland masks are applied. Pixel with at least 5% covered by the class are defined as a cropland/grassland pixel). This simplification implies that the crop/pasture phenology is static and therefore the growing seasons progress at a constant rate each year. The progress of growing seasons are described by three major phases: Start of Season (SOS), Maximum of Season (MOS) and End of Season (EOS). Start of Season (SOS) indicates the early stage of crop/grass emergence, defined as the date when the rising NDVI-curve cuts the threshold NDVIs: NDVIs=NDVImins + Ts.(NDVImax – NDVImins) NDVImax is the NDVI at the maximum of the cycle, NDVImins is the minimum before this maximum and threshold Ts is fixed to 0.25 for all land cover types. SOS is searched leftwards from NDVImax to NDVImins. Maximum of Season (MOS) indicates when crop/grass foliage is fully developed, defined as the date when the NDVI is at its maximum value. End of Season (EOS) indicates when crop/grass has reached physiological maturity, defined as the date when the descending NDVI-curve crosses NDVIe, This date does not necessarily correspond to the harvest period. NDVIe=NDVImine + Te.(NDVImax – NDVimine) NDVImax is the NDVI at the maximum of the cycle, NDVImine is the minimum after this maximum and threshold Te is set to 0.75 for cropland and to 0.25 for all other land. EOS is searched rightwards from NDVImax to NDVImine. Map legend label and pixel value mapping (half open intervals): <October Y-1: (-36)-(-6); November - December Y-1: (-6)-0; January - February: 0-6; March - April: 6-12; May - June: 12-18; July - August: 18-24; September - October: 24-30; November - December: 30-36; January - February Y+1: 36-42; >March Y+1: 42-72: Map flags: no seasons/no season 2: 251; no cropland/no grassland: 254 Global ASIS covers two crop/pasture seasons. Some countries have three or four crop seasons within a crop year. For these countries, Global ASIS cannot properly capture the crop phenology between the first and the last season (e.g. for a country has four crop seasons, the crop phenology of the 2nd and 3rd season).

Grid cells of the resource inventory can be made up of multiple soil types and terrain slope classes. GAEZ determines for each grid cell the respective characteristics of land units in terms of soil types and slope classes. Each of these component land units is separately assessed and assigned a suitability rating and simulated potential yield. The values are accumulated over all component land units in a grid cell, which produces a distribution of results falling into different suitability classes: very suitable (VS), suitable (S), moderately suitable (MS), marginally suitable (mS), very marginally suitable (vmS) and not suitable (NS).
